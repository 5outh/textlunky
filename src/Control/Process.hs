-- NB. if we change the type to:
-- type Process state cmd r = FreeF cmd r () (FreeT cmd (state) r) -> StateT state IO r
-- then the current Process is:
-- Process GameState TextlunkyCommand ()
-- which is interesting because we might be able to form something new from it,
-- but this is on the backburner because I don't really care that much. 
-- Just think it's interesting for discussion later.
