textlunky
=========

An unofficial text adventure version of mossmouth's roguelike platformer, Spelunky.

Still heavily under construction; currently working on at least getting a playable version of the Mines.

Design notes are located at [notes.md](https://github.com/5outh/textlunky/blob/master/notes.md) if you'd like to take a look at my design process.
